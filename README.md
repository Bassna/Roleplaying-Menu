## Roleplaying Menu ##

Welcome to the  Roleplaying Menu! This app is your one-stop-shop for managing and using your favorite RP lines, /FloatingDo's, and much more on Eclipse RP for GTA 5. This guide provides a quick start guide, and an in-depth overview of the application's features, and user interface navigation tips. This runs off one AutoHotkey script.

## Overview

The AutoHotKey Roleplaying Menu allows you to:

- Manage your Roleplay collection.
- Add RP Lines and Categories.
- Edit RP Line details.
- Quickly delete RP Lines or entire categories from your library.
- Use single or consecutive random Category RP Line playback.
- Adjust the app's size and transparency.

*(Using Notepad for Examples. Default will target GTA5.exe application)*

## Quick Start Guide

Before we dive into the features, here's how to get started. Download and run `RoleplayingMenu.AHK`. Then, press the `F5` hotkey to open the main Roleplaying Menu. A RPLines.txt file will be created to store your Roleplay lines in the same folder.

If you prefer not to use AutoHotKey, an alternative is to use `RoleplayingMenu.exe`. This executable runs the Roleplaying Menu on Windows and is identical to the AHK version and located in the OPTIONAL folder.

## User Interface

The Roleplaying Menu interface uses hotkeys for quick navigation:

- **F5**: *Open the Main Roleplay menu. Toggle the menu open or closed. Also stops any on-going typing*
- **SHIFT + F5**: *Toggle between Full Size and Compact size menus.*
- **CTRL + F5**: *Play a random category RP line, or multiple consecutively.*
- **F11**: *Pauses the current RP Line typing. Press again to resume the RP Line typing.*
- **F12**: *Stop and completely close the Roleplay Menu script.*

## Roleplay Menu Features

### Full Size and Compact Roleplaying Windows

The Full Size and Compact Roleplay Window provide various functionalities:

## Quick Stop Safety Feature ##

While the typing is active, hitting the Escape, Enter, any of the F1-F12, Alt, Tab, and similar keys will instantly stop and clear any ongoing RP lines. However, the F11 key is unique â€” it will allow you to pause and then resume the typing process as needed.
