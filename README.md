## Roleplaying Menu ##

Welcome to the  Roleplaying Menu! This app is your one-stop-shop for managing and using your favorite RP lines, /FloatingDo's, and much more on Eclipse RP for GTA 5. 

This guide provides a quick start guide, and an in-depth overview of the application's features, and user interface navigation tips. This runs off one AutoHotkey script.

## Features of the Roleplaying Menu

Dive into a streamlined experience that makes roleplaying management both fun and efficient. Here's what you can do with the AutoHotKey Roleplaying Menu:

- **Manage Your Collection**: 
   - Easily **Add**, **Edit**, or **Delete** any Roleplay lines or Categories, and oversee your entire Roleplay collection.

- **Random Playback**:
   - Engage in single or consecutive random Category RP Line playback for a surprise every time.

- **Customize App Appearance**:
   - Adjust both the size and transparency of the app to suit your preferences.



*(Using Notepad for Examples. Default will target GTA5.exe application)*

## Getting Started with Roleplaying Menu

Welcome! Let's quickly set you up to explore all the amazing features of Roleplaying Menu. Here's a simplified step-by-step guide:

### 1. **Download & Run**: 
   - **Option A**: Download and launch `RoleplayingMenu.AHK`.
   - **Option B**: If you're not keen on using AutoHotKey, there's an alternative just for you. Head over to the `OPTIONAL` folder and run `RoleplayingMenu.exe`. It's tailored for Windows users and offers the same experience as the AHK version.

### 2. **Accessing the Menu**:
   - Once you've launched the application, simply press the `F5` key. This will bring up the main Roleplaying Menu.

### 3. **Storing Your Roleplay Lines**: 
   - The first time you run the application, a file named `RPLines.txt` will be automatically created in the same folder. This is where all your Roleplay lines will be stored.

### 4. **Customize Your Content**: 
   - Inside the `RPLines.txt` file, you'll find some example categories and lines. These are just to give you an idea. Feel free to modify or delete them to make the Roleplay truly yours!

Now that you're set up, dive in and let the roleplaying begin!

## Quick Stop Safety Feature

- **Instant Stop**: 
   - Pressing keys like `Escape`, `Enter`, any of the `F1-F12`, `Alt`, or `Tab` will instantly halt and clear any ongoing RP lines.

- **Pause & Resume**: 
   - The `F11` key stands out from the rest. It lets you temporarily pause the typing process and then seamlessly resume whenever you're ready.
